# Problem statement

1. amazon.in
2. search "lg soundbar"
3. select lg brand checkbox
4. read product price and name
5. print product price and name in desc order of price via code.
6. if price is not present then consider price as zero
eg:- 
12000 : lg soundbar slbajsbd
42000 : lg soundbar Eh12368



I have used Python to test this scenario. There might be some extra utility files as well in the repository which gets created along with the project.
You can run the 'test_amazon.py' file to print the results.
